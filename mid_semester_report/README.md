## Objectives Met

As outlined in Chapter 1, the project had six primary objectives:

1. ✅ Develop a robust data pipeline for fetching and processing Nifty 50 historical data
2. ✅ Implement a diverse set of trading strategies
3. ✅ Create a comprehensive backtesting framework
4. ⏳ Design a performance analysis system (partially implemented)
5. ✅ Build a flexible and extensible architecture
6. ⏳ Provide a user-friendly interface (partially implemented)

The report details the progress made on each of these objectives, with four objectives substantially completed and two partially implemented at the mid-semester point.

## Next Steps

After the mid-semester report submission, the focus will be on:

1. Completing the implementation of the advanced strategies (Machine Learning and LSTM)
2. Enhancing the visualization components and reporting capabilities
3. Implementing the remaining backtesting framework features
4. Conducting more comprehensive testing and validation
5. Preparing for the final report and project demonstration
