# Dissertation Abstract

## Project Title: Nifty 50 Algorithmic Trading System

### Overview
This project focuses on developing an algorithmic trading system for the Indian market, specifically targeting the Nifty 50 index. The system implements multiple trading strategies and provides a comprehensive framework for backtesting and performance analysis.

### Objectives
1. Develop a modular architecture for algorithmic trading that separates data processing, strategy implementation, backtesting, and results analysis
2. Implement multiple trading strategies including:
   - Moving Average Crossover
   - Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
   - Bollinger Bands
   - Machine Learning strategy
   - LSTM Deep Learning strategy
3. Create a robust backtesting framework to evaluate strategy performance
4. Implement performance metrics calculation and visualization tools
5. Provide a user-friendly command-line interface for system operation

### Methodology
The system follows a modular architecture with components for data fetching, data processing, strategy implementation, backtesting, and performance analysis. It uses Python with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and deep learning frameworks for implementation.

### Expected Outcomes
1. A fully functional algorithmic trading system for the Nifty 50 index
2. Comparative analysis of different trading strategies
3. Performance metrics and visualizations for strategy evaluation
4. Insights into the effectiveness of different trading approaches in the Indian market
