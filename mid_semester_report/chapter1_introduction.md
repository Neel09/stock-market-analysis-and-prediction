# Chapter 1: Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

The Nifty 50 Algorithmic Trading System is a comprehensive framework designed to implement and backtest various trading strategies on the Indian market, specifically focusing on the Nifty 50 index. This project extends traditional algorithmic trading approaches by incorporating both technical analysis-based strategies and advanced machine learning techniques to analyze market data and generate trading signals.

The system follows a modular architecture that separates data processing, strategy implementation, backtesting, and results analysis, allowing for flexible extension and modification of individual components. This approach enables systematic comparison of different trading strategies under identical market conditions to evaluate their relative performance.

## 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. **Develop a robust data pipeline** for fetching and processing Nifty 50 historical data from multiple sources
2. **Implement a diverse set of trading strategies** including:
   - Traditional technical analysis strategies (Moving Average Crossover, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
   - Machine learning-based strategies
   - Deep learning strategies using LSTM networks
3. **Create a comprehensive backtesting framework** to evaluate strategy performance
4. **Design a performance analysis system** to calculate key metrics and visualize results
5. **Build a flexible and extensible architecture** that allows for easy addition of new strategies and data sources
6. **Provide a user-friendly interface** for running backtests and analyzing results

As of the mid-semester point, objectives 1, 2, 3, and 5 have been substantially completed, while objectives 4 and 6 are partially implemented and continue to be developed.

## 1.3 System Architecture

The system architecture follows a modular design pattern with clear separation of concerns between different components. The high-level architecture consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Components**:
   - Data Fetcher: Retrieves market data from various sources
   - News Fetcher: Retrieves financial news for stocks and markets
   - Sentiment Analyzer: Analyzes sentiment from financial news using LLM
   - Data Processor: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, including sentiment data

2. **Strategy Components**:
   - Base Strategy: Abstract class defining the strategy interface
   - Specific Strategy Implementations: Various trading strategies including:
     - Technical Analysis Strategies (MA Crossover, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
     - Machine Learning Strategies
     - LSTM Deep Learning Strategies
     - Sentiment-based Trading Strategies

3. **Backtest Engine**:
   - Simulates trading over historical data
   - Processes buy/sell signals from strategies
   - Tracks portfolio performance

4. **Analysis Components**:
   - Performance Metrics: Calculates key performance indicators
   - Visualization: Generates charts and plots for strategy performance

5. **Command Line Interface**:
   - Provides user interface to run backtests
   - Handles command line arguments and configuration

The components interact through well-defined interfaces, allowing for independent development and testing of each part of the system.

## 1.4 Project Scope

The current scope of the project includes:

1. **Market Coverage**: 
   - Primary focus on Nifty 50 index
   - Secondary support for other Indian indices (Nifty Bank, Nifty Next 50)

2. **Data Timeframes**:
   - Daily data as primary timeframe
   - Support for different historical periods (1y, 2y, 5y)

3. **Strategy Types**:
   - Technical analysis strategies
   - Machine learning strategies
   - Deep learning strategies

4. **Performance Evaluation**:
   - Key metrics: Total return, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown
   - Strategy comparison framework
   - Visualization of results

5. **Limitations**:
   - Backtesting only (no live trading implementation yet)
   - Limited to equity indices (no individual stocks or other asset classes)
   - No portfolio optimization or risk management beyond basic metrics

Future extensions may include real-time trading capabilities, additional asset classes, and more sophisticated portfolio management techniques.
