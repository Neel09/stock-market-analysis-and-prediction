Week 1: Project Initiation and Literature Review
●	Finalize project topic and scope.
●	Conduct an in-depth literature survey on stock prediction, machine learning techniques, technical analysis, and recent research in financial data science.
●	Define high-level objectives and gather key references.
Week 2: Requirement Analysis and System Design
●	List functional and technical requirements.
●	Define data needs (types, frequency, adequacy) and identify major NSE stocks for study.
●	Design overall pipeline architecture—modular components for data, features, modeling, evaluation, and visualization.
Week 3: Data Collection Setup
●	Research sources and APIs for reliable NSE data acquisition.
●	Build and test an automated data collection script.
●	Start collecting historical data for selected stocks.
Week 4: Data Storage and Preprocessing
●	Design a structure for storing raw and processed datasets.
●	Implement data preprocessing methods: handle missing values, remove outliers, normalize/scale data.
●	Document preprocessing steps and initial observations.
Week 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
●	Perform EDA to understand stock price trends, seasonalities, and anomalies.
●	Visualize basic statistics and distributions.
●	Summarize market-specific patterns and challenges.
Week 6: Feature Engineering - Technical Indicators
●	Implement calculation of key technical indicators: Moving Averages (SMA, EMA), RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, ADX, etc.
●	Create feature sets using price, volume, volatility, and calendar effects.
●	Visualize and validate features' relevance.
Week 7: Feature Engineering - Advanced & Custom Features
●	Develop complex features (e.g., lagged returns, rolling metrics, event-based features).
●	Conduct correlation analysis to understand relationships between indicators.
●	Refine feature selections for predictive modeling.
Week 8: Baseline Model Development
●	Build simple baseline models (e.g., logistic regression, SVM, decision trees).
●	Set up training and test data splits.
●	Evaluate initial model performance and establish reference metrics.
Week 9: Advanced Machine Learning Models
●	Implement ensemble learning models: Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM.
●	Tune hyperparameters using appropriate techniques (e.g., grid search, cross-validation).
●	Compare performance against baselines.
Week 10: Deep Learning Model Design
●	Develop and train LSTM and CNN-LSTM models for time-series forecasting.
●	Address challenges like data formatting, sequence length, and overfitting.
●	Summarize benefits/drawbacks of deep learning for stock data.
